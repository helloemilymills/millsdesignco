            <strong><p>I know how prone we all are to imposter syndrome, particularly as creatives. </p></strong>
            <p>I stumbled into the design industry by accident and doubted my abilities for over a year (despite holding a paid position). It wasnâ€™t until I got connected with other designers that I finally felt confident enough to call myself one.</p>
            <p>In thanks to the many people who have helped me find my creative confidence, my goal is to set others up for success by sharing everything I know about graphic design.</p>
